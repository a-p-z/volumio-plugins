# RF Amp Switch
RF Amp Switch allows you to control your amplifier over 433/315MHz LPD/SRD signals with [generic low-cost GPIO RF modules](https://pypi.org/project/rpi-rf/).

When the status of volumio changes to 'play' an ON code is transmitted, otherwise when the status change to 'stop' an OFF code is transmitted.
